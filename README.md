# Mushroom_Classification_Clustering
The purpose of this project is for me to learn and practice k-mean clustering, and see how it deal with catogorized data by using one-hot encoding, so the learning algorithm is written without using any machine learning libraries.\
The practice problem and data is from Kaggle: Mushroom Classification \
